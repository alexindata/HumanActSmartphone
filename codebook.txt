================================================================
R script 'run_analysis.r' is used to process raw data to the data in 'all_mean_std.txt' and 'tidy_avg.txt'.


Data processing steps:
------------------------ 

1. Merged the test and training sets to create one data set, by X_test with X_train and by y_test with y_train.
2. Used descriptive activity names to name the 6 activities in the data set.
3. Labeled the data set with the 561 descriptive variable names.
4. Extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. This processed data is in 'all_mean_std.txt'.
5. From the dataset in step 4, creates a tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. This data is in 'tidy_avg.txt'.


Subjects 
-----------------

There are 30 volunteers identified by an integer from 1 to 30.


Activities
-----------------

There are 6 activities, 'WALKING', 'WALKING_UPSTAIRS', 'WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS', 'SITTING', 'STANDING', 'LAYING'.


Feature Selection 
-------------------

There are 66 feature variables extracted from the raw dataset. The full list is shown below (*).

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
